# React Practice
Repository created to record my practice learning React with exercices base on [React Course](https://www.udemy.com/user/sgslo/) of [Stephen Grider](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-redux).

 ## Setup
| App Setup | Command |
| ------ | ------ |
| All | npm run setup-all |
| Comments | npm run setup-comments |
| Seasons | npm run setup-seasons |

## How to run it
To use any app, you just have to enter into it´s folder and run any of the scripts listed on it´s 'package.json' file. Each command runs with the following structure:
```sh
npm run <command-name>
```
In case you want to run all available commands on a row, execute the following command:
```sh
npm start
```
