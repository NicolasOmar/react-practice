# React Practice
Repository created to record my practice learning React with exercises based on the [Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-redux) of [Stephen Grider](https://www.udemy.com/user/sgslo/).

## Requirements
 - [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) v12.16.1 or above
 - For the eight exercise only
   - [OBS](http://obsproject.com/)

 ## Setup
After cloning the repo, go to the created folder and install the node packages.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/NicolasOmar/react-practice.git
cd react-practice
npm run setup-all
```
`setup-all` is the command to install all the projects, but if you want to do it one by one, you can change that last line for one of the following:
| App Setup | Command |
| ------ | ------ |
| All | `npm run setup-all` |
| Comments | `npm run setup-comments` |
| Seasons | `npm run setup-seasons` |
| Finder | `npm run setup-finder` |
| Videos | `npm run setup-videos` |
| Songs | `npm run setup-songs` |
| Blog | `npm run setup-blog` |
| Streams | `npm run setup-streams` |
| Languages | `npm run setup-languages` |
| Posts | `npm run setup-posts` |

## How to run it
To run any specific exercise, execute the following command in the projectÂ´s folder:
```sh
npm start
```
In the seventh exercise, you have to run the following commands in different terminals:
```sh
npm run api
npm run media
npm start
```
